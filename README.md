## Hi there, I'm Damian 👋

I’m a full stack software engineer with a passion for technology and creativity. In a nutshell, I create websites and web applications that solve problems and address business challenges. My expertise lies within front-end apps with the main languages in my tech stack including JavaScript, React, and of course HTML/CSS. Learning is a lifelong skill and on top of that, I love to read, spend time with family and take care of my garden.
